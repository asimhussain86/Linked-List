### Introduction
A linked list is a dynamic data structure that consists of nodes, each node pointing to the next node in the list. The linked list can be used to store and manipulate data efficiently.

This implementation of a linked list in C++ provides a simple and efficient way to create, modify, and traverse linked lists.

### Installation
To use this implementation of a linked list in your project, simply clone this repository to your local machine:


##https://github.com/asimhussain86/Linked-List.git
Once you have cloned the repository, you can include the LinkedList.hpp header file in your C++ code to use the linked list.

## Usage
To create a linked list, you can simply create a class/struct that contains a data and an address as objects:

               class Node
                     {
                         public:
                         int data;
                         Node *next;
                      };
You can add elements to the list using the add method:

        push(x,&head);
